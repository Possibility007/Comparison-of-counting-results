# Comparison-of-counting-results
Videos captured at 45° and 90° perspectives were processed using four methods (DBSCAN-DeepSORT, AdapDBSCAN-DeepSORT, DBSCAN-SORT, AdapDBSCAN-SORT) built upon YOLOv11n. Results confirm the dominance of AdapDBSCAN-SORT (CropTriangulator), with the 45° view yielding optimal performance.
