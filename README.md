# Comparison-of-counting-results
Videos captured at 45° and 90° views were processed using four methods (DBSCAN-DeepSORT, AdapDBSCAN-DeepSORT, DBSCAN-SORT, AdapDBSCAN-SORT). Their object detection is all based on YOLOv11. Results confirm the dominance of AdapDBSCAN-SORT (CropTriangulator), with the 45° view yielding optimal performance. For details, please refer to the video in the compressed package.
